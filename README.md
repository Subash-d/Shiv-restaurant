# Restaurant Menu Analysis Project

This project analyzes the performance of a restaurant's new menu introduced at the start of the year. The goal is to identify which menu items are performing well, which are not, and understand customer preferences. The analysis is done using MySQL with two primary tables: `menu_items` and `order_details`.
